// Structs part 1
// every piece of UI we design is built on a struct, with lots of structs inside.

// How to Compute Propety values Dynamically
// Property types, stored an computed
// 1. Stored is a var or let that holds a piece of data inside an instance of the struct
// 2. Computed calculates the value of the property dynamically everytime it is accessed
//    Computed props are a blend of stored properties and functions. Accessed like stored properties, but work like functions
// get {} and set {}
// Code that Reads, Code that Writes

struct Employee {

        set {
            vacationAllocated = vacationTaken + newValue // newValue is auto provided by Swift, stores whatever value the user is trying to assign the property
        }
    }
}
var archer = Employee(name: "Sterling Archer")

// How to take action when a Property changes
// Property Observers, special pieces of code that runs when a propeties value changes
// didSet to run when the property is change, (most likely used as we want to know the new value)
// willSet to run before the property is changed
// using a property observer means your functionality will be executed whenever the property changes.

// How to create Custom Initializers
// Must ensure every property has an initial value by the time the init finalizes
// all properties in an init must have an assigned value like self.name = name or number = Int.random()
